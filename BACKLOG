[BACK] Update has_player_already_shown_he_had_no_more_trump by looking at already played trumps and trumps in player hand

[BACK] Define helper functions:
    - is_player_in_contract_team(player, contract_team)
    - has_only_trumps(hand_cards, trump_color)
    - get_fresh_aces(hand_cards, game_history, current_round, rounds_first_player, trump_color)
        -> list Aces in hand (except for trump)
        -> for each Ace of color C, loop over round colors to see if any is equal to C
    - get_colors_to_be_cut(hand_cards, game_history, current_round, rounds_first_player, trump_color)
        -> for each plain color:
            -> check whether card (no 10 nor Ace) in hand
            -> check 1 opponent cut
            -> check NOT has_player_already_shown_he_had_no_more_trump for this opponent
    - get_winning_cards(hand_cards, game_history, trump_color)
        -> get highest card (plain & trump) for each color (if any in hand)
        -> for each color, use get_highest_[color_card|trump]_remaining to check whether it is the highest
    - can_opponents_cut(player, hand_cards, game_history, current_round, rounds_first_player, trump_color)
        -> check there other trumps than in hand_cards
        -> extract opponents from player
        -> for each opponent check NOT has_player_already_shown_he_had_no_more_trump
    - has_several_trumps(hand_cards, trump_color)

[BACK] Think about the Re-Loop code design

[BACK] Implement play_expert_first_in_round

[BACK] Add LEAF logs

[BACK] Add func tests by adding corresponding game configurations
