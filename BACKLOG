[BACK] Implement get_highest_color_card_remaining(game_history, trump_color)
    Inspire from and factorize has_highest_plain_color_card_in_hand

[BACK] Implement get_highest_trump_remaining(game_history, trump_color)

[BACK] Implement count_round_points(round_cards, trump_color)

[BACK] Implement must_cut(playable_cards) (only trumps...)

[BACK] Implement play_expert_third_in_round(...)
    As rules are a bit more complex than those in play_expert_fourth_in_round:
        define constants such as partner, opponent,...
        don't hesitate to make comparison directly in if/else rather than creating a specific function with ugly name
