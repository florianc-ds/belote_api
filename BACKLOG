[BACK] Integration Tests:
- Add flask.app logger in expert_agent
- Add logs to describe which leaf is called (01011), using the flask.app logger
- for each leaf:
    - define a realistic game configuration that ends up into the leaf
    - fill game_configurations.json accordingly
- Build a test factory into expert_agent_int_tests.py (based on json config & caplog fixture)
